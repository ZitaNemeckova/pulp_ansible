Sync is no longer available at the {remote_href}/sync/ repository={repo_href} endpoint. Instead, use POST {repo_href}/sync/ remote={remote_href}.

Creating / listing / editing / deleting Ansible repositories is now performed on /pulp/api/v3/ansible/ansible/ instead of /pulp/api/v3/repositories/. Only Ansible content can be present in a Ansible repository, and only a Ansible repository can hold Ansible content.
